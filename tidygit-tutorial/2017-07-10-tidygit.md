# What are `tidyextractors` and `tidygit`?

[`tidyextractors`](http://tidyextractors.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a Python 3 package for painless data extraction. This tutorial will introduce you to `tidygit`, a `tidyextractors` submodule for extracting data from source code repositories. You'll learn how to extract Git data, and explore how Git data can be used to understand the inner working of online software development communities.

# Getting Started

This tutorial is written assuming you:

* Know what Git is.
* Have a basic understanding of the Python language.
* Have a basic understanding of the Pandas data analysis framework.

If you haven't already installed `tidyextractors`, type the following into your command line:

```bash
pip install tidyextractors
```

If you're having trouble with `tidyextractors`, check out the [full documentation](http://tidyextractors.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) on Read the Docs.

# Extracting Git Data

`tidygit` extracts data from local Git repositories. This could one of your own local repositories, or one that you cloned from GitHub with `git clone`.

To extract data from your repository, run the following code:

```python
import tidyextractors.tidygit as tg

# Extract Data
gx = tg.GitExtractor('path/to/your/repo/')

# Get a DataFrame of commits
commits_data = gx.commits(drop_collections=False)

# Get a DataFrame of file changes
changes_data = gx.changes()
```

Now that you've got your data, you get get straight to analysis. First, let's talk about what data has been extracted. We've retrieved our data in two different forms:

* **Commits**: Information about individual commits, including what files were changed, who changed them, commit message, and more. Each row is uniquely identified by a hexadecimal commit hash (called `hexsha`).
* **Changes**: Information about individual file changes including the name of the file, the author, and how many lines were changed/added/deleted. Rows are uniquely identified by commit hash / file name pairs.

Now that you've got data, what to do with it? We'll look at two examples:

* Visualizing a project's history with Git commit data.
* Use file change data to analyze the structure of a software development community's collaboration network.

# The `tensorflow` Community

To get a glimpse of what you can do with Git commit data, we'll look at the source code repository for `tensorflow`, an open source library data flow graphs which has been gaining popularity as a tool for machine learning with neural networks. We'll be using the data we've extracted to take a very high-level look at the community's activity and collaboration structure.

## Project History

First, we're going to use `commits_data` to look at how community activity has changed over time. We'll use the total number of commits per month as a crude metric for the amount of development activity. You might be familiar with similar metrics in GitHub's [contribution graph](https://help.github.com/assets/images/help/profile/contributions_graph.png) feature.

The commit data we've extracted is organized by commit, and looks like this:

<table>
<thead>
<tr><th style="text-align: right;">  </th><th>hexsha  </th><th>author_name  </th><th>summary      </th><th style="text-align: right;">  total_lines</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td style="text-align: right;"> 5</td><td>3d4708d </td><td>Guillaume ...</td><td>Fix minor ...</td><td style="text-align: right;">            2</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align: right;"> 6</td><td>d1b931f </td><td>Jeroen Béd...</td><td>Merge bran...</td><td style="text-align: right;">       241834</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align: right;"> 7</td><td>9fec600 </td><td>Jeroen Béd...</td><td>- Fix the ...</td><td style="text-align: right;">           46</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align: right;"> 8</td><td>a5066f6 </td><td>Shanqing C...</td><td>Merge pull...</td><td style="text-align: right;">            6</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align: right;"> 9</td><td>bdabccd </td><td>Taehoon Le...</td><td>Fix typos... </td><td style="text-align: right;">            6</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

We had to drop some columns to fit on the page, but `commits_data` also has author email, timezone, numeric date, text encoding, lines deleted, lines inserted, and files changed.

```
In[]:
>>> commits_data.columns
Out[]:
>>> Index(['author_email', 'author_name', 'author_tz_offset', 'authored_date',
           'authored_datetime', 'total_lines', 'encoding', 'hexsha', 'summary',
           'total_deletions', 'total_files', 'total_insertions', 'total_lines',
           'type'],
          dtype='object')
```

Next, we'll use the data manipulation tools built into the Pandas framework to get monthly aggregate statistics, dropping the first and last months due to incomplete data.
